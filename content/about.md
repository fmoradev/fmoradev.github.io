Hello World 👋.

I'm an IT professional with more than 15 years of experience. I've worked in industries such as Insurance, Public Sector, StarUps, Retail, Telecomunication and Banking. I have experience in 🌐 Web and API Test Automation working with both on-premise and cloud environments.

Some of my skills are, quickly learning new skills and tools, problem solving, programming languages like Java and I have an intermediate level in JavaScript and Python for automation.

I also have a blog where I publish things related to GNU/Linux 🐧 and automation. There's a real person behind this profile, too! In my free time you might find me doing sports like running 🏃🏽 or play chess ♛.
